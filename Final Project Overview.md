Final Project Overview
Estimated time needed: 20 minutes

The final task of this capstone project is to create a presentation that summarizes the results of all tasks completed in the previous modules and labs. The presentation should tell a clear and engaging story of your data science journey throughout the project and be easy to follow.

In the next exercise, a PowerPoint template will be provided to help you begin creating your slide-based report; however, you may add additional slides, charts, and tables as needed.

This presentation is expected to be more detailed and technical than a typical high-level presentation intended for an executive audience.

After completing the detailed report, you should be able to easily condense it into a high-level presentation for executives and other stakeholders.

Once you have completed the PowerPoint presentation, it must be converted to PDF format before submission.

The final assignment includes one question worth 15 points and will be evaluated based on completeness, accuracy, clarity, and overall presentation quality.

The main grading will be based on the PDF presentation you have uploaded, which should include the following components:

* A link to your GitHub repository containing all completed notebooks and Python files (1 pt)
* The completed presentation submitted in PDF format (1 pt)
* Executive Summary slide (1 pt)
* Introduction slide (1 pt)
* Data collection and data wrangling methodology slides (1 pt)
* EDA and interactive visual analytics methodology slides (1 pt)
* Predictive analysis methodology slides (1 pt)
* EDA with visualization results slides (1 pt)
* EDA with SQL results slides (1 pt)
* Interactive map results using Folium (1 pt)
* Plotly Dash dashboard results slides (1 pt)
* Predictive analysis (classification) results slides (1 pt)
* Conclusion slide (1 pt)
* Creativity applied to enhance the presentation beyond the given template (1 pt)
* Inclusion of innovative insights (1 pt)

You will not be judged on:

* Your English language, including spelling or grammatical mistakes
* The content of any text or image(s) or where a link is hyperlinked to
